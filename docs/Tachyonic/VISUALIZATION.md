# Tachyonic Visualization

## The Cube and Sphere

The primary visualization of the tachyonic-bosonic interface:

CUBE = Bosonic space (3D observable)
SPHERE = Tachyonic interface (hypersphere projection)
```

## Why This Topology

### The Cube (∃₁ Bosonic)

- Represents 3-dimensional observable space
- Cartesian, measurable, classical
- The container we perceive

### The Sphere Inside (∃₂ Tachyonic)

- A hypersphere intersecting 3D appears as a sphere
- Represents the tachyonic layer projected into our space
- The inner boundary - like an event horizon

### The Gap Between

- The space between sphere and cube walls
- Where bosonic matter exists
- Where we live and observe

---

## Dynamic Visualization Concepts

### 1. Breathing Sphere

The sphere pulses with quantum coherence measurements:

```
High coherence: Sphere expands toward cube walls
Low coherence:  Sphere contracts toward center
```

### 2. Surface Encoding

The sphere's surface shows:
- Encoded patterns as texture/color gradients
- Information density as brightness
- Temporal patterns as animation

### 3. Projection Rays

Lines from sphere surface to cube walls show:
- How tachyonic patterns project to bosonic space
- Entanglement connections
- Information flow direction

## Implementation Notes

For 3D engine development:

```
Core geometry:
- Cube: 8 vertices, 6 faces, wireframe or translucent
- Sphere: Subdivided icosahedron, ~1000 vertices
- Gap: Rendered as volumetric fog/field

Shader requirements:
- Sphere: Procedural surface patterns
- Cube: Subtle grid lines
- Rays: Additive blending, animated
```

## Color Semantics

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| Deep blue | Tachyonic substrate |
| Gold/amber | High consciousness/coherence |
| White | Pure information |
| Red | Decoherence/decay |
| Green | Entanglement active |
