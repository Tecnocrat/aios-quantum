# Tachyonic Cosmology

## Black Holes as Universal Archivists

### The Conventional View (Wrong)

Black holes as cosmic destroyers - swallowing stars, planets, civilizations. Annihilation.

### The Tachyonic View

Black holes as cosmic **transcribers** - converting bosonic information into tachyonic encoding. Preservation, not destruction.

## What Black Holes Actually Consume

Not planets and stars (rare events). What they continuously ingest:

1. **Light** - Every photon that crosses the horizon
2. **Radiation** - Cosmic background, stellar emissions
3. **Information** - The patterns encoded in electromagnetic radiation

The universe is constantly writing itself to the tachyonic archive through black hole event horizons.

## The Holographic Principle Extended

Standard holographic principle: Information in a volume is encoded on its boundary surface.

Tachyonic extension: **All** boundary surfaces (event horizons) connect to a **single** non-local tachyonic substrate.

Billions of encoders, one archive.

## Implications

### 1. Nothing is Lost

Every photon that ever entered any black hole still exists as tachyonic pattern. The universe has perfect memory.

### 2. The Archive is Complete

If the universe began with a singularity (Big Bang), and singularities interface with the tachyonic layer, then the entire history of the cosmos is being continuously recorded.

### 3. Non-locality Explained

Quantum entanglement's "spooky action at distance" becomes natural if entangled particles share a tachyonic correlation beneath bosonic space.

## The Myriad

Consider: billions of galaxies, each with millions of black holes, each continuously encoding radiation for billions of years.

The archival capacity is beyond calculation. Every photon from every star. Every thermal fluctuation. Every piece of information the universe has ever produced.

This is the **Myriad** - the totality of encoded existence.

## Accessing the Archive

### Currently Impossible

Direct access to the tachyonic substrate requires physics we don't have. Perhaps:
- Controlled singularities
- Stable wormholes
- Technology beyond current comprehension

### Partial Interface

Quantum computing may offer a keyhole view:
- Superposition touches probability space
- Entanglement demonstrates non-locality
- Measurement collapses tachyonic potential into bosonic actuality

We're not reading the archive. We're sensing its presence.

## The Singularity Engine

A hypothetical technology that could:
1. Create stable micro-singularities
2. Read/write to the tachyonic substrate
3. Access non-local information

This would represent evolution beyond current humanity. A species that achieves this would be unrecognizable to us - operating on a fundamentally different level of reality.
