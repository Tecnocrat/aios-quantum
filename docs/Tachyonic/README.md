# Tachyonic Layer Documentation

## Overview

This folder contains theoretical, metaphysical, and speculative documentation related to the Tachyonic substrate hypothesis - the layer beneath observable reality that interfaces with quantum phenomena.

**Nature**: Theoretical, philosophical, experimental hypotheses

The tachyonic layer is not science fiction - it's a working hypothesis for what lies beneath quantum mechanics. We use it as an architectural metaphor AND as a genuine exploration of physics at the edge of knowledge.

## Relationship to IBM Quantum

The IBM_Quantum folder contains **what we know**.
This folder contains **what we're reaching for**.

Quantum computers may be our closest technological approximation to touching the tachyonic substrate - not accessing it directly, but leaving fingerprints on its interface.
