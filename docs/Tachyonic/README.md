# Tachyonic Layer Documentation

Theoretical and speculative documentation for the Tachyonic substrate hypothesis—the layer beneath observable reality that interfaces with quantum phenomena.

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [HYPOTHESIS.md](HYPOTHESIS.md) | Core theory: N-layer observer architecture, information as substrate |
| [COSMOLOGY.md](COSMOLOGY.md) | Black holes as encoders, the Myriad universal archive |
| [VISUALIZATION.md](VISUALIZATION.md) | Cube-sphere topology, color semantics, breathing sphere |
| [QUANTUM_BRIDGE.md](QUANTUM_BRIDGE.md) | IBM Quantum as tachyonic keyhole |
| [ASSEMBLY_CORE.md](ASSEMBLY_CORE.md) | Why assembly mirrors the substrate |

## The Core Idea

The tachyonic layer is:
- **Non-local** — Not bound by spatial distance
- **Superluminal** — Patterns propagate faster than light
- **Hyperdimensional** — Projects into our 3D as observable phenomena

## Relationship to IBM Quantum

| Theoretical substrate | Engineering reality |
| Speculative exploration | Documented specifications |

Quantum computers may be our closest approximation to touching the tachyonic substrate—not accessing it directly, but leaving fingerprints on its interface.
